# TetrAIs

I will be exploring DQN in the game of Tetris with a friend. Due to the large state space of the game, DQN seems to be a viable option for this project. Please note that there have been successful projects in the past, so this is mostly an educational project. To address the problem of reward sparsity and create a more configurable project, we will be using this [environment](https://github.com/Max-We/Tetris-Gymnasium).

We hope to also explore a random decision tree approach using the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. If we are able to reach this stage, we will put the two RL paradigms side by side to compare their strengths and weaknesses.
